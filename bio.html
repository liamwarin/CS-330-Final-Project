        <p> Hailing from Washington, D.C., Liam Warin is a 21-year-old Chicago-based electronic music DJ and producer. At the age of 19 in his first year at Northwestern University immediately following the COVID-19 pandemic, Liam began exploring the Chicago underground house scene, a primary influence in his current sound. He soon fell in love with the joy expressed in these events and started his own venture into the industry.

        <p> Drawing inspiration from classic Chicago house, 90s rave, and modern popular sounds alike, Liamâ€™s DJ sets span across genres, seamlessly blending in 4/4 beats with vocals that are sure to have the audience singing. A journey like no other, Liam seeks to share the same passion, enthusiasm, and sheer energy that he brings to the decks with the audience, immersing the crowd into a journey through a mutual love of music.
